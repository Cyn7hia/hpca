**hpca** provides an efficient implementation of the Hellinger PCA for computation word embeddings.
See the [EACL 2014 paper](http://lebret.ch/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/eacl2014.pdf) for more details.

## PREREQUISITES

 This project requires:
  * Cross-platform Make (CMake) v2.6+
  * GNU Make or equivalent.
  * GCC or an alternative, reasonably conformant C++ compiler.
  * Zlib v1.2.5
  * OpenMP API (optional)
  * Doxygen (in order to make documentation which is optional)

## BUILDING
 
 This project uses the Cross-platform Make (CMake) build system. However, we
 have conveniently provided a wrapper configure script and Makefile so that
 the typical build invocation of `./configure` followed by `make` will work.
 For a list of all possible build targets, use the command `make help`.

 **NOTE**: Users of CMake may believe that the top-level Makefile has been
 generated by CMake; it hasn't, so please do not delete that file.

## INSTALLING

 Once the project has been built (see "BUILDING"), execute `sudo make install`.
 See [Install](INSTALL.md) for more details.
